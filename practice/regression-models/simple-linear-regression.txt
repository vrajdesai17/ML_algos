                        SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
                       --------------------------

1) Formula : y = mx + c
   where, 
   y = Dependent Variable
   x = Independent Variable
   m = Slope which is basically like a connector between x and y for eg :
       one unit change in x will cause 2 units change in y
   c = constant

2) Salary V/s Experience

Salary
^
|  .---/
|     /(best fit line)
|    /---.
|   /
|  /----.(other data points)
| /
|/(assume this start point as 30K...so x = 0 hence y=c...hence it means that for eg. when person enters a company with zero Experience,his salary would be 30K)
|
|__________________________________> Experience


3) .(actual observation(yi))
   | 
   |
   |
___.___(Modeled observation(y^))

4) The distance between above two points d: yi - y^

5) Simple linear regression will draw several lines and compute this: SUM(square(d))
   for each line.The line with the minimum value will be the best fit line.
   This is called ordinary least squares method.

6) Regression Models are branches of ML that aim to predict some continous
   real numbers like salary or temprature.
